Battery Levels:

    If the battery level is below 30%, stop the current operation and return to the charging station.
    If the battery level is between 50% and 30%, issue a warning to the operator to charge soon.
    If the battery level is between 70% and 50%, monitor closely and prepare for charging after completing the current task.
    If the battery level is 100%, ensure no overcharging occurs by switching to standby mode.

Sensor Data:

    If the odometer data becomes noisy or inconsistent, stop the robot and inspect the encoder installation.
    If the temperature sensor exceeds a predefined threshold, pause the operation and notify the operator for system cooling.
    If the gyroscope sensor data fluctuates abnormally, recalibrate the sensor or restart the robot system.
    If proximity sensors detect an obstacle within 10 cm, stop the robot immediately to avoid a collision.
    If the LiDAR sensor loses track of the environment, slow down and activate backup navigation systems.

Speed Control:

    If the robot speed exceeds 3 m/s, issue an alert and slow down to a safer speed.
    If the speed drops below 0.5 m/s during an active task, check for obstructions or mechanical issues.
    If the robot is traversing over rough terrain, reduce speed by 50% for safety and stability.
    If the robot is approaching a tight corner, automatically reduce speed by 25%.

Navigation & Pathfinding:

    If the robot is off its predefined path by more than 5 cm, pause and recalculate the route.
    If the robot detects it’s in a restricted area, stop immediately and return to the authorized path.
    If the GPS signal is lost for more than 10 seconds, initiate a stationary hold until the signal is regained.
    If the robot is moving backwards at speeds above 1 m/s, reduce speed or halt to avoid collisions.

Mechanical & Structural Integrity:

    If the robot’s arm or tool reaches its maximum load capacity, issue a warning and stop the operation to avoid overload.
    If vibrations exceed a predefined safe threshold, halt the robot and inspect for mechanical faults.
    If the robot's wheel friction exceeds a certain value, check for debris or surface issues and clean if necessary.
    If motor temperature exceeds safe limits, stop the robot and allow the system to cool down before resuming operations.

Communication & Operator Interaction:

    If communication with the operator is lost for more than 30 seconds, return to the base station automatically.
    If the operator sends a manual override command, halt all automatic functions and switch to manual control mode.
    If the robot receives a shutdown command, stop all operations safely and power down the system gradually.
    If the robot detects a low signal strength in Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, initiate data backup and notify the operator of connectivity issues.

Task-Specific Rules:

    If the robot’s tool encounters unexpected resistance, stop the task and check for blockages.
    If the robot’s camera detects inconsistent object recognition for more than 5 seconds, recalibrate the vision system.
    If a task exceeds the maximum allowed time, pause the operation and prompt the operator for further instructions.
    If a payload weight sensor indicates an imbalance, pause the robot and request manual correction.

Emergency Protocols:

    If an emergency stop button is pressed, immediately halt all operations regardless of the current task.
    If the robot tilts more than 20 degrees from its upright position, stop and trigger an emergency balance protocol.
    If fire or smoke is detected by sensors, initiate a complete system shutdown and send an emergency alert to the operator.
    If the robot's internal diagnostics detect a critical error in the system software, initiate a safe shutdown procedure.
